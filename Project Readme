AI Operations Assistant

A multi-agent AI system built for the GenAI Intern Assignment. This assistant uses a Planner-Executor-Verifier architecture to handle complex natural language tasks by orchestrating real API calls.

Architecture

Planner: Deconstructs user queries into a sequence of tool-specific steps.

Executor: Processes the plan, handles API authentication, and gathers raw data.

Verifier: Critiques the gathered data and formats the final response for the user.
